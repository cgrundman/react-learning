# Shopping App

This is a bsic shopping app. The goal is to show advanced state handling to prevent prop drilling. This is where a parent component generates its state and passes it down as props to its children componetnts that do not consume them. THe children components instead meraly pass down the props to their own children components. This problem creates more boiler plate code and is generally bad practice.
