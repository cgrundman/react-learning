# Debugging

Debugging in React, just like in other languages, can be a challenge. This code, taken from the investement calculator, provided chances to learn how to use developer tools and logical troublshooting to solve problems. Since the app was described in the investement calculator section, no images or visual documentation is provided. The documentation as for the fixes in the code are all found in the comments in the files.
