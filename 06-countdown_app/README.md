# Countdown App

This app showcases the `useRef` and `forwardRef` hooks. This app is designed around a countdown game. The app features 4 simulataneous countdown games. The closer the user is to the time, the higher the score. If the user goes over, the game automatically ends and the user loses. The user can enter their name in the form in the header. Here is the opening page:
