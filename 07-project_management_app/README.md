# Project Managment App

This is another applicaiton with the `useState` hook. This app is designed to be a page to track projects and tasks. Many components are needed to do this. To begin, the home page is seen below:

Here you can see the projects that are already saved and a button to add a project in the sidebar. The main page displays a welcome message. The typical first step would be to start a new project. This is seen below:

![PM App Add Project](https://github.com/cgrundman/react-learning/blob/main/images/project_management_app_2.png)

If the data is entered incorrectly, a warning message is displayed to warn the user.

If a project is created, the project page is displayed. This page displays the title, description, and due date. Since this is a new project, there is only an input to add subtasks to the project.

After tasks have been added, the tasks can be seen listed below with an option to delete if needed.
