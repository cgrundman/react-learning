# Login Styling

This project demonstrates custom formatting with .jsx and React.

## Main page

This app is a simple example for conditional formating. While this can be done in CSS, adding dynamic styling in .jsx aids development teams and keeps the project flexible

## Inccorect Login

If the email does not contain an '@', the styling changinges for both the button and label. This also occurs when the password is less than 6 characters. There are no correct login credentials, but this is a good showcase of React functionality.
