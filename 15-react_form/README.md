# React Forms

This sample project shows methods for using forms and validating information from forms in react. The app contains two main components, Login and Signup. Login is split between Login.jsx and StateLogin.jsx. These show multiple ways to use ``useState`` and ``useRef`` to handle validation. 

Login and Signup. Login is split between Login.jsx and StateLogin.jsx. These show multiple ways to use ``useState`` and ``useRef`` to handle validation. The form in both cases is displayed as shown below:
