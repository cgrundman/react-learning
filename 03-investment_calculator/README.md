This is an example project, that contains an Investment Calculator App.

## Simple Investment Calculations

This app performs very fast calcualtions on a simple investment scenario. The parameters used are: duration of investment, static annual return on investment, initial investement, and subsequent static annual investment.

The calculator returns values for each given year: the end of year sum in the investment, the yearly interest, the total accrued interest, and the investment capital gained at each year.
